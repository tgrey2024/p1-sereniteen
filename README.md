## Introduction
Sereniteen is the first HTML/CSS/Bootstrap website that I built as part of my first individual project on the AI-Augmented Full-Stack Bootcamp course at the Code Institute. Its aim is to help site users to understand what anxiety is, how it may affect teenagers, and provide basic guidance and links to resources and professional help.

### Project Brief
The site user's goal is to find "accessible, beginner-friendly information" on a mental health issue. The scope of mental health is very broad, so I have chosen to focus on anxiety in teenagers. The aim is to present information on common symptoms and how to manage stress using a "supportive and organised layout".

### Users
Potential users of the site are:
- teenagers who may be worried about themselves
- parents of teens who may be concerned about their children.
- friends of teenagers who may be worried about their friends having anxiety

Co-pilot was used to generate some personas, which were then reviewed and refined to enrich the analysis of users and their requirements:

##### Persona 1: Jake, The Anxious Teenager, Age: 16, Occupation: Year 11 Student, Tech Comfort: High

Background: Jake is a secondary school student who excels academically but struggles with social anxiety. He often feels overwhelmed and is looking for ways to manage his stress and anxiety.

Goals:
        * Learn effective coping mechanisms for anxiety.
        * Access resources and tools specifically designed for teenagers.
        * Find relatable stories and experiences from other teens dealing with anxiety.

Challenges:
        * Feeling embarrassed or reluctant to seek help from adults.
        * Difficulty concentrating on long articles or technical content.


#### Persona 2: Sarah, The Concerned Parent, Age: 42, Occupation: Full-Time Working Mum, Tech Comfort: Moderate

Background: Sarah is a dedicated mother of two teenagers. She has noticed that her 16-year-old daughter has been more anxious lately and wants to find reliable resources to help her cope.

Goals:
        * Find practical tips and strategies to help her daughter manage anxiety.
        * Access easy-to-understand information on the causes and symptoms of anxiety.
        * Locate support groups and professional help in her area.
Challenges:
        * Limited time due to her teaching job and family responsibilities.
        * Overwhelmed by the vast amount of information online and unsure of its credibility.


#### Persona 4: Anna, The Supportive Friend, Age: 17 Occupation: Sixth-form Student, Tech Comfort: Moderate

Background: Anna is a supportive friend who wants to help her best friend, who has recently opened up about their anxiety struggles. Anna is eager to find ways to be there for her friend.

Goals:
        * Learn about anxiety and how to support a friend dealing with it.
        * Find tips and advice on how to approach conversations about mental health.
        * Access resources that she can share with her friend.

Challenges:
        * Ensuring she provides accurate and helpful support without overstepping boundaries.

### User Stories
User Stories and the associated Acceptance Criteria and Tasks were generated using Microsoft Copilot. These were then reviewed and edited to be SMART and focused for the delivery of an MVP. A Project Board was set up in GitHub Projects to track project progress, and the user stories were prioritised using MoSoCoW.
